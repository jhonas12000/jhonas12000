I am Yonas Weldemichael, and I am interested in writing clean and scalable codes. I steped first into the programming world in 2020 after I joined NuCamp Bootcamp, 
and learned fullstack web development. Currently doing some projects focusing mainly front end web development. I live in the Bay Area, California. You can reach me out
